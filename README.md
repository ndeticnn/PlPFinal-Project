Collins Ndeti's PLP Software Development Scholarship Final Project

Mitfol Hotels

A huge thank you for the opportunity that the entire PLP fraternity has granted us. i couldn't be prouder.
I was amazed and delighted i received that email being announced by you as a receiver of your scholarship.
I am very grateful that an organization like this stands for students. 
It states the sense of help for the student to help us to remember how the nation minds about future schooling.
I wish someday I will have the ability to support students to fulfill their purpose as you have supported me.  
Being very very honest to all, this is actually not just a scholarship for me but actually I see it as a golden opportunity
with the actual help of which I can definitely have a very very bright as well as a successful future. 
Thank you for giving for this very scholarship. 

My Project is in the hospitality sector. I've created a hotel website that gives geusts a glimpse view of what to expect
at Mitfol Hotels & Spa And rsort Centre.
